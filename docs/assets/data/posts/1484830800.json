{"title":"\"Don’t communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating.\"","body":"\u003cp\u003eIf you've been around the Go language long enough, then you must have come across the famous Go proverb \u003cstrong\u003e\"Don’t communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating.\"\u003c/strong\u003e at some point in time. And if you haven't then now you have! :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first glance it looks like the proverb is composed of 2 different goals. i.e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoal 1: Communication\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoal 2: Share Memory\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, that sounded like - \"Don't eat an apple; drive a car.\" Two unrelated sentences stringed together to form advice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found this confusing and started up a conversation about it with my colleagues at work and it was after listening to everyone's interpretation that I gained a clear understanding of what the proverb truly means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe proverb is meant as advice on how to communicate within the Go programming language. Therefore the sentence  has only 1 goal which is communication and not 2 as I earlier thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommunication is the only goal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is similar to saying - \"Don't live to work; work to live\". Where the only goal is to live or teach one how to live\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I expected the sentence to be was something along the lines of: \"Don't communicate by sharing memory; instead communicate by ....\". Now thinking of it, I guess that would have been too easy and boring. Whoever wrote that proverb wanted us to think a bit harder of it's meaning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you found this or still find this confusing, share your thoughts and let's talk :)\u003c/p\u003e"}
